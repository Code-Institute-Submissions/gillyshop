About:

Millennial Pink is a humourous and ironic online store that sells artworks/photographs aimed at millennials, with items that appeal to millennials such as cactii, galaxies, palm trees etc. 

The site originally began as a vintage clothing store called Starry Starry Night. It then evolved into a jewellery store before eventually becoming an online art/photography store. The biggest challenge for an online art store was actually finding royalty free images that were of a high enough quality to use so the site evolved over time because of this. Ideally, it would contain art, illustrations and more typical millennial items like avocados, unicorns and llamas but finding images was a real challenge so I had to keep it more simple.

Starting off:

Most of my ideas begin as a visual representation in my head which is how Starry Starry Night began. I could see the exact type of font I wanted and so built the initial homepage around that in my head. When it evolved into Millennial Pink, I kept the visual framework the same and just adjusted the font to something more 'millennial'. My early drawings which can be found in the mockups section. I knew I wanted to keep the site layout clean and simple with a focus on some of the key art pieces to create a really nice visual entrance to the site. I made some wireframes to get an idea of how I wanted it to look and then began building the site.

Building the site:

The site was built using the lessons provided by Code Institute. While much of the code is my own, I also used the code from the lessons to build the site.
