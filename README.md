Millennial Pink is an online store that sells artworks/photographs thats aimed at millennials, with items that appeal to millennials such as cactii, galaxies, palm trees etc. 

The site originally began as a vintage clothing store called Starry Starry Night. It then evolved into a jewellery store before eventually becoming an online art/photography store. The biggest challenge for an online art store was actually finding royalty free images that were of a high enough quality to use so the site evolved over time because of this. Ideally, it would contain art, illustrations and more typical millennial items like avocados, unicorns and llamas but finding images was a real challenge.
